# Multiple-Linear-Regression-for-Startup-Profit-Prediction-Python  

**Description:**  

In this project, I implemented a multiple linear regression model to predict the profit of startups based on various factors such as R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, and the state where the startup is located. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Udemy course "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science".

**Additional Details:**  

**Data Source:** The dataset used for this project is available in the repository under the name "50_Startups.csv". It contains information about the R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, and profit of 50 different startups.
**Libraries Used:** This project utilizes numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
**Model Evaluation:** The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score.

**Conclusion:**  

This project demonstrates the application of multiple linear regression in predicting startup profit. By analyzing factors such as R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, and the state where the startup is located, we can make informed predictions about the profitability of startups. The code and dataset are available in this repository for further exploration and experimentation.
